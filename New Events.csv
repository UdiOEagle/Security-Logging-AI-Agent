This new event would detect potential CAN ID spoofing or fuzzing attacks by logging rejected frames with HRH, received ID, length, and matched RxPduId (if any), enabling anomaly detection without overlap to SEV_CAN_RX_ERROR_DETECTED (hardware-detected errors only)."
2026-01-06T21:47:19.450356,AUTOSAR_CP_SWS_CANInterface.pdf,SEV_CAN_XL_INVALID_SDU_TYPE,"ControllerId, Mailbox->Hoh, Mailbox->XLParams.SduType, Mailbox->XLParams.Vcid, Mailbox->XLParams.PriorityId, Mailbox->XLParams.AcceptanceField","CAN XL introduces new frame attributes (7.27) like SDU Type, VCID, Priority ID, and Acceptance Field for filtering (7.20). No existing event covers frames with unrecognized SDU Types (e.g., non-01h/03h) or mismatched XL parameters dropped per [SWS_CANIF_00955]. Logging these detects protocol misuse or injection attempts targeting CAN XL-specific fields, distinct from legacy RX errors."
2026-01-06T21:47:19.450356,AUTOSAR_CP_SWS_CANInterface.pdf,SEV_CAN_PN_TXFILTER_BYPASS_FAILURE,"ControllerId, TxPduId, PnTxFilterState (enabled/disabled)","Partial Networking TxFilter (7.25) blocks non-NM PDUs until first TxConfirmation or RxIndication ([SWS_CANIF_00750-00752]). Unexpected bypasses (e.g., due to timing attacks or config errors) could leak sensitive PDUs during wakeup. No event logs PnTxFilter state changes or violations, unlike controller states; this adds PN-specific security observability without duplicating SEV_CAN_TX_ERROR_DETECTED."
