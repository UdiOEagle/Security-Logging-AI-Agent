Security transformer errors like E_SEC_NOT_AUTH and E_SEC_NOT_FRESH are explicitly defined as soft errors with established DEM integration paths. No additional highly relevant new security events are identifiable that aren't already addressed or similar to existing mechanisms."

These primarily cover functional specifications, data flows, HMI/sensor/actuator interactions, and architectural rationales, with no detailed security mechanisms, authentication failures, cryptographic errors, unauthorized access attempts, or anomaly detections that would warrant new, highly relevant security event logs distinct from existing AUTOSAR security logging (e.g., those in diagnostic or safety modules). Security aspects are high-level (e.g., key validation in Immobilizer/PASE) and already align with standard event types like authentication failures or access denials."

2026-01-07T14:47:52.493881,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_AIPowertrain.pdf,"**Explanation:**

After reviewing the AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_AIPowertrain.pdf specification (R25-11), I have identified that this document focuses on **explaining application interface design decisions** for the Powertrain Engine Domain rather than defining security event logging requirements.

The specification covers:
- Torque request interfaces and terminology
- Powertrain domain architecture and component decomposition
- Signal flow and coordination mechanisms
- Modeling and naming conventions

**Why no new security event logs are recommended:**

1. **Scope Mismatch**: This is an explanatory document (EXP) describing *application interfaces*, not a security or diagnostics specification. Security event logging is typically addressed in separate AUTOSAR specifications such as:
- Diagnostic specifications (e.g., AUTOSAR_CP_SWS_DiagnosticCommunicationManager)
- Security specifications (e.g., AUTOSAR_CP_SWS_SecureOnboardCommunication)
- Functional Safety specifications (ISO 26262 related)

2. **No Security Event Definitions Present**: The document explicitly states (Section 6.2) that ""AUTOSAR does not provide a Safety Concept for Powertrain systems. This must be done at the project level."" Security event logging would fall under this project-level responsibility.

3. **Existing Interface Coverage**: The torque coordination, arbitration, and state management interfaces already defined (e.g., PTC arbitration between driver and chassis requests, transmission shift interventions) provide the foundational data that *could* be logged, but the specification does not prescribe security event logging mechanisms.

To identify relevant security event logs for powertrain systems, a review of AUTOSAR security and diagnostics specifications would be more appropriate."
2026-01-07T14:47:58.399394,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_AIUserGuide.pdf,"The AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_AIUserGuide.pdf document describes the methodology, metamodel, tool structure, and processes for defining standardized Application Interfaces (AIs) including blueprints, data types, port prototypes, computation methods, life cycle states, backward compatibility rules, and ARXML generation. It contains no descriptions of runtime behaviors, security mechanisms, authentication, access controls, cryptographic operations, anomaly detection, or other security-relevant events that would warrant new security event logs. The focus is purely on specification authoring and validation tooling, not executable software with security concerns."
2026-01-07T14:48:02.262253,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_ApplicationLevelErrorHandling.pdf,"The document comprehensively covers all major application-level error handling mechanisms (plausibility checks, substitute values, voting, agreement, checksums, execution sequence monitoring, aliveness monitoring, status/mode management, reconfiguration, reset, error filtering, memory protection, timing protection) with their FDIR applicability, error models, and AUTOSAR references. No gaps exist for highly relevant new security event logs that are not similar/identical to existing error detection, isolation, or recovery logging implied by these mechanisms (e.g., via DEM, WdgM, OS protection hooks)."
2026-01-07T14:48:06.270320,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_ARTI.pdf,"This document (AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_ARTI) is an explanatory guide for ARTI implementation focusing on debugging, tracing, and runtime visibility for OS tasks, RTE runnables, ISRs (CAT1/CAT2), hooks, and state transitions. It lacks security-specific mechanisms, threats, or error conditions (e.g., no protection hooks, access violations, or fault events) that would warrant new security event logs. Existing ARTI traces are purely for performance/timing analysis, not security monitoring."
2026-01-07T14:49:41.132335,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_BSWDistributionGuide.pdf,"This document (AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_BSWDistributionGuide.pdf) is an explanatory guide focusing on BSW distribution concepts for multi-core systems and safety mechanisms. It describes architectural patterns (master/satellite, MCAL multi-core types, partition mappings, stubs/wrappers for cross-partition calls), configuration parameters (e.g., EcucBusToPartitionMapping, task mappings), and error scenarios (e.g., memory/timing violations via OsProtectionHook), but does not define or require new runtime-detectable security events. No highly relevant new security event logs are warranted, as existing AUTOSAR mechanisms (Det, Dem, OsProtectionHook) already cover relevant faults like protection violations in this context."
2026-01-07T14:49:44.740521,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_CDDDesignAndIntegrationGuideline.pdf,"The document provides design and integration guidelines for Complex Device Drivers (CDDs) in AUTOSAR CP R25-11, focusing on implementation recommendations, file structures, documentation, and interfacing with standard BSW modules (e.g., Det/Dem for error reporting, Det errors in user's manual, StbM for time synchronization). It does not describe specific CDD-internal security events, protocols, or mechanisms that would warrant new, highly relevant security event logs beyond existing AUTOSAR error tracing via Det/Dem. Any potential events (e.g., interface access violations) would be similar to standard BSW error reporting already covered."
2026-01-07T14:49:52.987340,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_ErrorDescription.pdf,"**Explanation:**

After comprehensive review of the AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_ErrorDescription.pdf (Document ID 377, R25-11), this document focuses exclusively on **functional error handling mechanisms** within the Classic Platform's Basic Software (BSW) stackâ€”specifically communication (CAN) and NVRAM error detection, isolation, and recovery processes.

The document does not address **security-specific event logging**. The error descriptions cover:

- **Communication errors**: CAN Bus Off, timeouts, transmission buffer issues, deadline monitoring, transport protocol failures
- **NVRAM errors**: Flash/EEPROM read/write/erase failures, CRC checks, write verification, redundancy loss, consistency checks

These are **functional safety and reliability mechanisms** (FDIR: Fault Detection, Isolation, Recovery) aligned with ISO 26262 requirements, not security event logs addressing threats such as:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Cryptographic failures
- Authentication/authorization violations
- Malicious data injection
- Security state transitions
- Audit trail requirements

**Security event logging** would typically be specified in separate AUTOSAR security-focused specifications (e.g., SecOC, Secure Onboard Communication, or security architecture documents), which are not the subject of this error description document."
2026-01-07T14:49:57.057818,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_FirmwareOverTheAir.pdf,"The provided document excerpt (AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_FirmwareOverTheAir.pdf) is an explanatory specification focusing on FOTA architecture, procedures (download, installation, activation, rollback), state machines, Dcm interactions, and best practices. It lacks detailed security mechanisms, threat analysis, or references to security event logging/auditing. Security is minimally mentioned in section 5.4.1 as interfacing considerations (e.g., encryption, HSM), but no specific security events or logs are defined or implied that would warrant new, highly relevant security event logs distinct from standard AUTOSAR/Dcm error handling."
2026-01-07T14:50:05.588962,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_FunctionalSafetyMeasures.pdf,"**Explanation:**

After a comprehensive review of the AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_FunctionalSafetyMeasures.pdf (R25-11), the document already provides extensive and well-structured security event logging coverage across all major functional safety mechanisms:

1. **Memory Partitioning** (Section 2.1.3) - Detection and reaction mechanisms are clearly defined with MPU/MMU hardware exception handling and OS protection hook implementations.

2. **Timing Monitoring** (Section 2.2.3) - Comprehensive logging via Watchdog Manager with Local/Global Supervision Status, DEM (Diagnostic Event Manager) integration, and multiple recovery mechanisms.

3. **Logical Supervision** (Section 2.3.3) - Graph-based execution monitoring with checkpoint transitions and status computation already specified.

4. **End-2-End Protection** (Section 2.4.3) - Communication fault detection with state machine status reporting and DEM integration.

5. **Hardware Diagnostics** (Sections 4.1.3, 4.2.3) - Core Test and RAM Test with production error reporting to DEM.

The specification consistently leverages the **Diagnostic Event Manager (DEM)** as the centralized logging mechanism and includes context variables such as:
- Local/Global Supervision Status
- Checkpoint identifiers and transitions
- E2E profile states and fault types
- Hardware test results
- OS Application and Task identifiers

No additional highly relevant security event logs were identified that would represent genuinely new logging requirements beyond what is already comprehensively specified in this R25-11 release."

These already comprehensively cover security event reporting through existing mechanisms such as IdsM handling events from BSW modules/SW-Cs, Firewall raising events for unexpected packets, and integration with Det/Dem for error logging. No highly relevant new security event logs are identifiable that are distinct from these established capabilities."
2026-01-07T14:50:16.681109,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_MacroEncapsulationofInterpolationCalls.pdf,"The document AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_MacroEncapsulationofInterpolationCalls.pdf describes a methodology for generating encapsulation macros for interpolation routines (curves/maps) to simplify application code, relying entirely on static code generation from ARXML metadata (DataAccessPoints, BswModuleEntries, ImplementationDataTypes, RecordLayouts). There are no runtime mechanisms, dynamic behaviors, invalid states, or security-relevant operations that would warrant new security event logs; all potential issues (e.g., incorrect routine mapping) are design-time concerns addressed by tooling and configuration validation, not runtime monitoring via DEM/DET."
2026-01-07T14:50:20.952420,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_ModeManagementGuide.pdf,"The AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_ModeManagementGuide.pdf focuses on functional mode management concepts (ECU states, communication management, diagnostics, multicore interactions) without describing security-specific mechanisms, vulnerabilities, or events that would warrant new security event logs.

2026-01-07T14:50:24.823416,AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_NVDataHandling.pdf,"The NV Data Handling Guideline (AUTOSAR_CP_EXP_NVDataHandling.pdf) primarily describes architectural concepts, synchronization mechanisms (implicit/explicit), block management types (Native/Redundant/Dataset), use cases for RTE access, and configuration parameters like CRC comparison, write verification, error recovery, and resistance to software changes. It lacks description of specific security threats, attack vectors, runtime security violations, or security-relevant error conditions that would warrant new, distinct security event logs beyond standard NvM/DEM production errors (e.g., NVM_E_VERIFY_FAILED). Any potential events (e.g., CRC mismatches, invalid blocks) would overlap with existing NvM error reporting rather than introducing highly relevant new security-specific logging."
